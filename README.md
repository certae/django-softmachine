[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/certae/django-softmachine/badge.png?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/r/certae/django-softmachine?branch=master)

CeRTAE [SoftMachine](http://www.certae.org/index.php?id=88) proposes an approach based on DATARUN method. This approach consists in achieving the interfaces of an application by the construction of views from a standard data model. In other words, you can prototype and export a new application model. 
The system architecture is a Web MVC variant, this means that we use the basic concepts of Model, View and Controller adapted to a Web App.

## Get Started
SoftMachine can be installed and used in two ways:

 1. Using `pip` to install a standalone Python package you can reuse in new projects
 2. Deploying as a Django application

### Software requirements:

* Ext JS 4.2.1
* Python 2.7
* Django 1.6.1
* graphviz ([OPTION] For export database diagram)
* south ([OPTION] For export database migration)

For testing:
```
$ pip install requests
```

### Install using pip
SoftMachine is best installed via PyPI. To install the latest version, run:
```
pip install django-softmachine
```
or Install from github source:
```
pip install git+git://github.com/certae/ProtoExt.git
```
Edit your **settings.py** file and add `protoLib` and `prototypeur` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` section:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    ...
    'protobase',
    'protoLib',
    'prototype',
    'myapp',
)
```
Also edit your **urls.py** and add the following url patterns:
```python
urlpatterns = patterns('',
    # ... omited code
    url(r'^', include('protoLib.urls')),
    url(r'^protoDiagram/', include('dbDesigner.urls')),
)
```
>See [<i class="icon-share"></i> Setup a new project](#setup-a-new-project) section for a detailed description.

### Deploying as Django app

#### Production requirements:

* Python-mysqldb  / PyGreSQL / ...  ( DbServerConector )
* Apache
* Mod_wsgi


#### Installation
Those steps are based on a Ubuntu server, but it is applicable to others Linux distributions.

Hands-on: start by checking Python version in a server terminal, usually Ubuntu comes with Python 2.7. The next step is Django installation, in a terminal type:
```script
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install Django==1.6.1
```

To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type python from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django
```python
>>> import django
>>> print django.get_version()
```

Install South by the command:
```
sudo pip install south
```

If you are going to use MySQL, you must install the python driver:
```
sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb
```

We assume that Apache web server is already installed, if not:
```
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

And for an easy deploy install:
```
sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi
```

Now we are going to configure the web server:
```
sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default
```

Inside the tag `<VirtualHost *:80>`
insert those lines:
>`Alias /static/admin/ /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/`
`WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/prototypeur/ProtoExt/src/softmachine/prototypeur.wsgi`

We are almost there, go to the home folder:
`cd /var/www/`
create a new prototypeur directory
`mkdir prototypeur`
and extract the ProtoExt-master.zip (downloaded from https://github.com/victorette/ProtoExt) code inside the prototypeur folder, rename the new folder to ProtoExt.
Go to the new folder and make sure that `settings.py` is following the security remarks mentioned below. The App won't work is this file is configured improperly.

Download Ext JS from [Sencha.com](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download/), extract it in `/var/www/prototypeur/ProtoExt/static` and rename the extracted folder to **extjs**.
Synchronize the database: 
`python src/manage.py syncdb`

Make sure that all steps were executed and restart the web server:
`sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`

Open chrome or firefox :

If running from aptana : `http://127.0.0.1:8000/protoExt`

If using Apache : `http://<server_ip>/protoExt`

## Security remarks
In order to achieve the security requirements, the `settings.py` should be modified before deploying the Django project.

`SECRET_KEY`
Instead of hardcoding the secret key in the settings module, we are going to load it from a file:
```python
with open('/etc/secret_key.txt') as f:
    SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
```

This file will be generated by CeRTAE upon request.

`DEBUG`
Never enable debug in production so set it to False (`DEBUG = False`)

Split configuration is used to avoid sending sensitive data to GitHub. This configuration is based on DEBUG variable. If debug is enabled the System is going to load “settings_development.py” otherwise it will import “settings_production.py”.
```python
if DEBUG :
    from softmachine.settings_development import *
    with open( PPATH + '/src/softmachine/secret_key.txt') as f:
        SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
else :
    from softmachine.settings_production import *
    with open('/etc/secret_key.txt') as f:
        SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
```
Those files contain information about DATABASES, ALLOWED_HOSTS, TEMPLATE_LOADERS, TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS, TEMPLATE_DIRS, INSTALLED_APPS and EMAIL configurations.

## Reusing SoftMachine in customized projects

If we run the project as a simple Django application we're able to create a relational database model graphically (like [DBDesigner](http://www.fabforce.net/dbdesigner4/)) or via forms. More details in the [docs](http://certae.github.io/ProtoExt/) *French only.

Once that we've defined our model, entities, attributes and relationships it's possible to create and customize a functional **prototype** (CRUD) based on entities.

If you're ready to generate a new App, follow the steps below. You should also check this [Example](https://github.com/victorette/certae-rai)

### Generating an application
When the prototype is finished we can export the model to generate a new application. The output is a `models.py` file containing the basics for a new Django app.

### Setup a new project
Create a new Django project, if you don't know how, take a look on this [Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/intro/tutorial01/).
Your new project should looks like:
```
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py
    myapp/
        __init__.py
        models.py
        tests.py
        views.py
```
At this point you should have modified those files **settings.py** and **urls.py** as mentioned in [Install using pip](#install-using-pip) section.

### Extend a template

django-softmachine has two main templates, protoExt.html and protoDebug.html. Both have the same blocks, the difference is that protoExt.html uses minified JavaScript files.
See the code bellow to understand how the template is organized (code outside blocks were omitted).
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="fr">
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		{% block sitetitle %}
		<!-- put site title here. i.e.: <title>Proto Certae</title> -->
		{% endblock %}

		{% block meta %}
		<!-- put meta content here. i.e.: <meta name="author" content="CeRTAE U.Laval"> -->
		{% endblock %}
		
		{% block extjs %}
		<!-- Use this block to replace the extjs implementation-->
		{% endblock %}
		
		{% block defaultstylesheets %}
		<!-- You can replace all application stylesheets, 
		if you don't want to use the default css put something here -->
		{% endblock %}
		{% block extrastylesheets %}{% endblock %}
		

		
		{% block extjsloader %}{% endblock %}
		{% block configproperties %}<!-- You can replace application's variables here -->{% endblock %}
		{% block javascript %}{% endblock %}
	</head>
	<body></body>
</html>
```

Now we're going to extend the templates to customize your application. Django's template inheritance mechanism allows templates to extend other templates and replace named blocks within them.
Create a new file inside your templates dir, name it `debug.html` (it's a good idea to start using the debug mode). Replace the blocks as you wish, for consultation, you can see the example below:
```html
{% extends "protoDebug.html" %}

{% block sitetitle %}
<title>RAI Certae</title>
{% endblock %}

{% block meta %}
<meta name="description" content="">
<meta name="author" content="CeRTAE U.Laval">
{% endblock %}
		
{% block extrastylesheets %}
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="{{ STATIC_URL }}css/rai.css">
{% endblock %}

{% block extjsloader %}
<script type="text/javascript">
// Place to use Ext.Loader methods
</script>
{% endblock %}

{% block configproperties %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/config/configProperties.js"></script>
{% endblock %}
{% block javascript %}
<script type="text/javascript" src="{{ STATIC_URL }}js/rai/app.js"></script>
{% endblock %}
```


### Add a new ExtJS app

SoftMachine UI is based on ExtJS framework. If you don't like it, you're free to use whatever you want. Just keep in mind that using ExtJS could avoid a lot of hard work :)

So you've decided to use ExtJS. We suppose that you're comfortable with the concept of Single Page Application.
SoftMachine UI application is also extensible, you can create your own app, but your app.js must extend `ProtoUL.Application`
```javascript
Ext.application({
    name: 'RAI',
    paths: {
        'RAI' : 'static/js/rai'
    },

    extend: 'ProtoUL.Application',

    controllers: [
		'RAI.controller.RaccordementController'
	]
});
```

Once this is done you are free to create everything that you want, but to execute you code you must create an especific action inside your model [Executing JavaScript](#executing-javascript).

### Customizing models

#### Executing JavaScript
You have defined a new application and there is a need to use this code for an especific table. Create an action inside `protoExt` and add the parameters `name`, `executeJS` and `jsCode` as you can see in the cexample code :

```python 
class MyAmazingTable(ProtoModel):
    # omitted code ...

    protoExt = { 
        "actions": [
            { "name": "doAmazingAction", "selectionMode" : "single", "executeJS": True, "jsCode":"Ext.create('RAI.view.raccordement.MainWindow',{selectedModel:selectedKeys}).show();",},
        ],
    } 
```
If your action uses a selected row you should also add `selectionMode` (`single` or `multiple`). SoftMachine will validate if there is a row selected, otherwise nothing will happen.
If you need to get the selected row(s), you must send the parameter `selectedKeys` to your Window

#### Dynamic window
You also can execute actions based on dynamic forms. All fields must be defined under `actionParams` 

```python 
class OtherTable(ProtoModel):

    protoExt = { 
        "actions": [
            { "name": "doFindReplace", "selectionMode" : "multi", "refreshOnComplete" : True,
               "actionParams": [
                     {"name" : "fieldName", "type" : "string", "required": True, "tooltip" : "field name (meta)" }, 
                     {"name" : "oldText", "type" : "string", "required": True, "tooltip" : "Old values: pyreg.sub(); @all for all text" }, 
                     {"name" : "newText", "type" : "string", "required": True, "tooltip" : "New values" }, 
                ] 
            },
        ],
    } 
```
You should take a look on the models code to check other custom actions

#### Auto-increment
If for any unknown reason you need to create *another* auto-increment field, you just need to add the attribute `_autoIncrementField` and specify which column will use the auto-increment, note that this column should be `IntegerField`

```python
class Evaluation(ProtoModel):
    id_evaluation = models.IntegerField(blank = False, null = False)
    date_evaluation = models.DateField(blank = True, null = True)
    auteur_evaluation = models.CharField(blank= True, null= True, max_length= 255)
    description_evaluation = models.TextField(blank = True, null = True)

    _autoIncrementField = 'id_evaluation'
```
  
### Production
If you're ready to deploy your new App, check the security remarks and the Django documentation ([Deploying Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/))

> Hint: To serve SoftMachine static files copy `...Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/protobase/static` to your local static folder...
