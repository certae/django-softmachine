## ProtoExt
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/victorette/ProtoExt.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/victorette/ProtoExt)

CeRTAE [ProtoExt](http://www.certae.org/index.php?id=88) proposes an approach based on DATARUN method. This approach consists in achieving the interfaces of an application by the contruction of views from a standard data model.
The system architecture is a Web MVC variant, this means that we use the basic concepts of Model, View and Controller adapted to a Web App.

## Software requirements:

* Ext JS 4.2.1
* Python 2.7
* Django 1.6.1
* graphviz
* South

## Software requirements (prod):

* Python-mysqldb  / PyGreSQL / ...  ( DbServerConector )
* Apache
* Mod_wsgi

Suggested IDE : [Aptana Studio 3](http://aptana.com/)

## Security remarks
In order to achieve the security requirements, the `settings.py` should be modified before deploying the Django project.

`SECRET_KEY`
Instead of hardcoding the secret key in the settings module, we are going to load it from a file:
```python
with open('/etc/secret_key.txt') as f:
    SECRET_KEY = f.read().strip()
```

This file will be generated by CeRTAE upon request.

`DEBUG`
Never enable debug in production so set it to False (`DEBUG = False`)

Split configuration is used to avoid sending sensitive data to GitHub. This configuration is based on DEBUG variable. If debug is enabled the System is going to load “settings_development.py” otherwise it will import “settings_production.py”.
```python
if DEBUG :
    from settings_development import *
else :
    from settings_production import *
```
Those files contain information about DATABASES, ALLOWED_HOSTS, TEMPLATE_LOADERS, TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS, TEMPLATE_DIRS, INSTALLED_APPS and EMAIL configurations.

## Installation
Those steps are based on a Ubuntu server, but it is applicable to others Linux distributions.

Hands-on: start by checking Python version in a server terminal, usually Ubuntu comes with Python 2.7. The next step is Django installation, in a terminal type:
```script
sudo apt-get install python-setuptools python-dev build-essential
sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install Django==1.6.1
```

To verify that Django can be seen by Python, type python from your shell. Then at the Python prompt, try to import Django
```python
>>> import django
>>> print django.get_version()
```

Install South by the command:
`sudo pip install south`

If you are going to use MySQL, you must install the python driver:
`sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb`

We assume that Apache web server is already installed, if not:
`sudo apt-get install apache2`

And for an easy deploy install:
`sudo apt-get install libapache2-mod-wsgi`

Now we are going to configure the web server:
`sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-available/default`
Inside the tag <VirtualHost *:80>
insert those lines:
	`Alias /static/admin/ /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/django/contrib/admin/static/admin/`
	`WSGIScriptAlias / /var/www/prototypeur/ProtoExt/src/ProtoExt/prototypeur.wsgi`
	
We are almost there, go to the home folder:
`cd /var/www/`
create a new prototypeur directory
`mkdir prototypeur`
and extract the ProtoExt-master.zip (downloaded from https://github.com/victorette/ProtoExt) code inside the prototypeur folder, rename the new folder to ProtoExt.
Go to the new folder and make sure that `settings.py` is following the security remarks mentioned above. The App won't work is this file is configured improperly.

Download Ext JS from [Sencha.com](http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/download/), extract it in `/var/www/prototypeur/ProtoExt/static` and rename the extracted folder to **extjs**.
Synchronize the database: 
`python src/manage.py syncdb`

Make sure that all steps were executed and restart the web server:
`sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart`

Open chrome or firefox :

If running from aptana : `http://127.0.0.1:8000/protoExt`

If using Apache : `http://<server_ip>/protoExt`
